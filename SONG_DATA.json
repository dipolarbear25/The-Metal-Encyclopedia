Fight 'til death!/nThey refuse to die like cattle/nFighting for his life/nNo holds barred, so close to revenge/nClose but yet so far/nThen he stands before him/nIt's like the battle fades/nHe sees his father's eyes/nAs he's struck into the waves/nBack on northern shores (northern shores)/nJust as he once swore (he once swore)/nHe has met his fate (met his fate)/nIn these cold dark waves (cold dark waves)/nHe looks to clouds up high/nA dead and distant stare/nShe comes out of the light/nSee the chariot flare/nStanding on the shore/nHe hears her silent call/nFreyja leads him through the door, into the Great Hall",
